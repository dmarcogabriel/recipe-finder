## Instructions

First install the dependencies by running:

```bash
yarn
```

Or 

```bash
npm i
```

Then run the `json-server` with the command:

```bash
yarn serve
```

This will start the `server.js` file that implements the `json-server` package.

Finally, run the application:

```bash
yarn dev
```
